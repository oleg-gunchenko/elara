# elara
The tools4j elara project provides an efficient, zero garbage framework to implement event sourcing applications.  

The event store is pluggable and two default implementations are available: [mmap](https://github.com/tools4j/mmap) and [chronicle](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue).
